# Real ESP32 Security Implementation

## Project Status
**Current Phase**: Planning & Research

This branch contains our work on transforming the ESP32 Security Simulation into an actual security device capable of running on real ESP32 hardware and protecting real networks.

## Goals

1. Port the simulation to run on actual ESP32 hardware
2. Replace simulated packet handling with real packet capturing and analysis
3. Optimize the codebase for ESP32's resource constraints
4. Add proper security hardening for production use
5. Create deployment and installation documentation

## Key Features to be Implemented

- Real packet capture and analysis using ESP-IDF
- Hardware-optimized firewall and IDS components
- Secure dashboard with authentication
- Over-the-air updates for security signatures
- External storage support for logs and signatures
- Physical status indicators (LEDs, optional display)

## Documentation

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions in the following areas:
- C/C++ implementations of key security components
- ESP32 hardware interface development
- Performance optimizations for resource-constrained environments
- Security testing and hardening

## Timeline

Estimated project completion: 12-18 months
